# Exit the maze excercise using graphs

These excercices show algorithms to process graphs etc.

Source code: [maze-network.py](../src/04-graph-algorithms/maze-network.py)

This excercise has to calculate the best possibility to travel through a maze.

The following picture shows the maze, represented as a graph for every possibility.  The different algorithms will search for the moves, needed to get from **s**(tart) to **t**(arget)
